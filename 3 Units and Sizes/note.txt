In CSS, the rem unit is a relative unit of measurement that is based on the
font size of the root element (html element).

The em unit is also a relative unit of measurement, but it is based on the font size
of the element it is applied to.

For example, if you set the font size of the html element to 16px, and you set the
font size of a p element to 2rem, the font size of the p element will be 32px.
If you then set the font size of a span element to 0.5em inside the p element,
the font size
of the span element will be 16px (0.5 * 32px).

One advantage of using rem units is that it allows you to specify sizes relatively to
the root element, which can make it easier to scale the size of elements on a page.
em units can be more useful when you want to specify sizes that are relative to the
font size of their parent element.

Which unit you should use depends on your specific use case. In general,
it's a good idea to use rem units for font sizes and em units for other length
values such as margin and padding.





rem - the rem is relative to the default element which is set by the browser,
 it is not
relative to any other element in the html page just the root element(set by the
browser)

1rem = 16px by default for p tags
2rem = 32px y default for p tags

em - used to define the size relative to the parent element
if you have
 <main>
    <p>hello</p>
    </main>

and say:
main {
    font-size:2rem;

}

p {
    font-size: 2rem;
}

the p tag becomes 64px big because it is looking at the parent element "main"
is already 32px big

you can set font-size of elements to rem and padding to em
