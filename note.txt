In CSS, the box-sizing property specifies how the dimensions of an element are calculated.
 There are two possible values for box-sizing: content-box and border-box.

If the value of box-sizing is content-box, the dimensions of an element are calculated
based on the size of its content. This means that the width and height properties apply
only to the element's content, and do not include padding or border.

If the value of box-sizing is border-box, the dimensions of an element are calculated
based on the size of the border box. This means that the width and height properties
include the element's content, padding, and border.




The border-box property styles the margin and padding of the element based on the
root element border to contain and fit the padding and margin on the font size

It will retain the actual height and width of the element even when padding and
margin is added to make the element bigger

By default it is set to content box which is not really useful

using border-box will help fit the set padding to contain the absolute font-size
of the element to retain a calculated absolute value
