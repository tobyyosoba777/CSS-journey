A pseudo-class in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special
 state of the element. It allows you to apply styles to an element based on the
  element's attributes or location within the document.

To learn about pseudo-classes in CSS, you can follow these steps:

    Familiarize yourself with the different types of pseudo-classes available in CSS.
     Some examples include:

    :hover - applies styles to an element when the user hovers their mouse over it
    :active - applies styles to an element when it is being activated, such as when
    a button is being clicked
    :focus - applies styles to an element when it has focus, such as when a user
     is typing in a text field
    :visited - applies styles to a link that has already been visited

    Practice using pseudo-classes in your CSS by creating a simple HTML page and
     applying styles to elements based on their state. For example, you can try
      changing the background color of a button when it is hovered over by the user.
